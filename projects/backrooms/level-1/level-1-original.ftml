//I had simply gone deeper into the rabbit hole.//

I sat with my back against the cold wall, too dehydrated to produce tears. I was exhausted and weak, but I was overjoyed; I had finally escaped that yellow hell. Who knows how long I wandered through those rotting halls, enduring the non-stop buzzing and slosh of rancid carpet?

I never knew how much I could appreciate silence.

I had hoped the flickering wall would send me home, but no dice. Instead, I found a strange, off-color room filled with notes. Some mentioned [[[phenomene-1-FR|no-clipping]]], and others advised me to find strange-looking walls to enter, none of which made sense until I saw one myself. It was so ominous, like something out of a dream. Although now, this whole place felt just like a waking nightmare.

This whole situation was bizarre. I had stumbled in the dark of my home, trying and failing to not step on broken glass, and had found myself in a mono-yellow labyrinth. It was a miracle I was wearing real shoes and jeans, but I had been ill-equipped to enter such a strange place. I had been scared at first, but after wandering for so long, it had fully flipped over into just being a taxing ordeal.

I laughed to myself as I looked around; I had stared at yellow for so long the walls around me had taken on a violet hue. The cement floor was rough to the touch, but I was grateful to sit on something that wasn’t wet.

The area was some sort of barren parking structure with miles of unforgiving concrete leading into the distance. Random clangs echoed through the pipes on the ceiling, though it was far less obnoxious than the incessant hum-buzz of the yellow rooms. There were puddles of liquid scattered across the ground; however, I wasn’t that desperate. Yet.

I gingerly began to put my shoes back on, my feet blistered from trudging through the moist carpet. It had taken a few hours for them to dry, but now, I was ready to move forward.

Congratulations, wanderer!

If you're reading this article, this means you have successfully escaped [[[level-0|The Yellow Halls]]], commonly referred to by other wanderers like you as "Level 0".

As you have most likely read on the [[[Manila Room]]] documents, you have unfortunately "[[[phenomene-1-fr|no-clipped]]]" into another realm known as "The Backrooms". Thankfully, you have managed to leave Level 0, and learned how to use no-clipping to your advantage.

Following your no-clipping, you are now on **Level 1**, the second level of the Backrooms, also nicknamed "The **Habitable Zone**". This place, unlike The Yellow Halls, is much more complex and deadly, as it is home to various creatures and phenomena that you aren't used to yet. Fortunately, however, you will also find resources such as food or water, as well as settlements of people who will help you stay safe.

This article will describe everything you need to know to survive here, as well as explain how to reach us. The following groups have helped write this article and will actively help you if you encounter them here. Try finding them by looking for their logos!
* [[[cercle-ariane|The Ariane Circle]]]
* [[[b n t g|The B.N.T.G.]]]
* [[[The M.E.G.]]]
* [[[nomades|The Nomads]]] (no permanent base, only temporary settlements)
* [https://backrooms-wiki-cn.wikidot.com/speednoclippers/offset/1 The Speednoclippers] (when they set up Registration Spots)

Keep in mind that not all humans in the Backrooms are friendly, so be wary of anything that moves, [[[level-1#toc5|entity]]] or not. You can find explanations and advice about both of them down below.

How long had it been since I had last seen another person? Weeks?

Months?

It was certainly before I had fallen into this forsaken world.

I couldn’t tell; time didn’t really exist here. There was no waxing and waning of the sun, just the artificial wash of overhead lights.

What was this place?

It seemed man-made, all of it, but it contained an otherworldliness that distinctly wasn’t. While I was grateful for the change of scenery, I still felt trapped in this apparently infinite abyss. The halls stretched on for eternity, almost warping ahead of me. They felt off. Wrong, perhaps. I was probably just exhausted, but it seemed like the halls twisted in improbable ways far off in the distance. My head ached; little flickers of disorienting visual anomalies danced in the corners of my vision.

This place was probably just getting to me.

The puddles around me smelled unclean, the plastic scent of stagnation clinging to the air. I avoided them, but still my thirst drew me closer to them. The air felt stuffy and humid; if only I could crack a window and get any modicum of fresh air.

Small piles of debris littered sections of the floor: pieces of wood, packing material, and metal. I glanced through some of it, hoping in vain that any of it contained some manner of sustenance. As I passed one, I saw something odd from the corner of my eye. A crowbar was peeking out from under the crushed wooden planks. I pulled it out, gauging its weight with my hand. It was sturdy, with small flecks of rust patterned on its corrugated gray surface. I did a test swing, satisfaction growing in me as it whisked through the air. //This could be a useful tool//, I thought to myself. I hung it from my belt and continued on.

The halls rolled on and on, my only companions were my footsteps and the intermittent rumbling through the pipes above. I wanted to scream, shout, do whatever it took to find another soul in this endless emptiness, but I was terrified that something else would respond.

There had to be other people here, the notes in that room were almost certainly handwritten. I had to keep looking; they were somewhere, and maybe, just maybe, I could find my way home.

+ The Halls
[[/div]]

Right now, you are standing in the halls. They're wide and open areas with a consistent architecture of bland, discolored walls that stretch over for miles, with the occasional concrete pillars maintaining the structure's integrity. Many wanderers describe this place as "an endless chimera between an underground parking lot and an abandoned warehouse", a description that might spark some familiarity for you.

The halls of the **Habitable Zone** host two specific phenomena. [[[level-1#toc4|The apparition of crates]]], being the only way to get resources, and the [[[level-1#toc3|frequent flickering of the lights]]], creating small blackouts where the anomalous wildlife of the level tends to come out. Both will be developed below in their specific parts, so refer to the links if you need this information now.

++* Navigation

caption=Example of a landmark that can be used for navigation.
]]

The **Habitable Zone** is subject to what we call "non-Euclidean geometry". This means that distances you perceive are fabricated by your senses, and that your surroundings aren't what you think they look like. Examples of this include:
* Walking for a few dozens of seconds, yet finding yourself where you thought the horizon was.
* Wandering around for several minutes, only to realize you barely moved from your original location.

Thankfully, there is a way to navigate this place without relying on your deceiving senses, and it directly involves your surroundings:

[[div class="blankquote"]]
* First, try localizing a particular landmark at a reasonable distance (a table, a colored pillar, an electric panel, a crate...).
* Walk towards it carefully, never looking away from it.
* If you don't appear to get any closer, it means the landmark is way further from you than you thought.
 * In this case, look for another landmark and repeat the process.
[[/div]]

This will allow you to always know where you are by using a reference point, helping you track where you are at all times.

Once you start getting used to this anomalous environment, the need to rely on external objects will gradually fade away[[footnote]]As the level layout isn't shifting over time, a trained individual can look around and deduce the real form of the non-Euclidean architecture, even if their senses remain misleading at first.[[/footnote]].

This doesn't mean you should take too much confidence so hastily either! Getting too self-assured is the number one cause of death among new wanderers. Distances you see will always be artificial, so don't think you mastered non-Euclidean exploration in only a few hours!

++* Sectors

As you start walking deeper into the level, you might notice some slight environmental changes. Pillars with different forms than before, walls featuring more decrepit colors... Those shifts in the landscape are tied to a partition of the level into similar yet distinct zones wanderers call "sectors". You can think of them as "sub-levels" of the **Habitable Zone**; still a warehouse, but with some architectural differences between each.

Why would we care about changes that are so subtle? The answer is simple. Thanks to their existence, groups managed to name and locate several key areas of the level. This makes navigating the **Habitable zone** a much easier experience, as using them allows anyone to figure out which part of **Level 1** they're in. Obviously, those sectors remain huge, so keep using landmarks for navigation!

Grey walls and flooring with huge concrete pillars compose the Aquila Sector, the most well-known part of the **Habitable Zone**. More reminiscent of a parking lot than a warehouse, the blandness of the landscape is only interrupted by small pipes on the ceiling, leaking damp water on the floor that isn't safe for consumption.

It's likely you're familiar with this environment already, since new wanderers usually noclip here from the [[[Level 0|Yellow Halls]]]. Due to this, the [[[the m e g|Major Explorer Group]]] has set their Base Alpha in this sector, allowing for patrols to find newcomers more easily.

Said patrols are common, as they actively look for newly no-clipped wanderers to escort safely to the base. They are usually in teams of four to five people and can be recognized from afar by their bright lime yellow outfits and their eagle insignia. If you spot them, you can safely ask them for help!

More colorful than the Aquila Sector, the Gild Sector features more lights and a more diverse architecture than other parts of **Level 1**. Do not be fooled by this, however, as its structure remains non-Euclidean like the rest of the level.

This area of the **Habitable Zone**, more akin to a warehouse, hosts more crates than any other discovered location of the level. Therefore, if by chance you get to wander in this sector, make sure to gather some food and bottles while you can (see [[[level-1#toc4|Crates]]] later on).

Make sure to also gather some valuable items in case you manage to find the [[[Trader's Keep]]], the base of the [[[b n t g|Backrooms Nonaligned Trade Group]]]. Since they don't shelter anyone for free, bartering will be your best chance to get a home, even temporary, in the Gild Sector.

The Gothic Sector gets its name from its more curved structure, with arches and circular pillars making up most of the area.

It hosts Hippocrates-1, the main settlement of Team Hippocrates of the [[[cercle-ariane|Ariane Circle]]]. Seeking their base is advised, especially if you require medical care, as biological research and medicine are the focus of the settlement. Their group mission of protecting wanderers will lead them to offer you a temporary home, although it can become permanent if you have the skills to work for the team.

[[[Backrooms Remodeling co|Shadowy creatures in overalls]]] can be found within it, aimlessly repairing the structure of the place. So far, the progress has yet to be physically observed, despite the place being in this state for at least decades.

All of the personnel is working while completely ignoring the presence of other biological life. This led to some accidents where wanderers reported getting harmed due to their imperturbable work. It is therefore advised to stay away from them and their contraptions. Since there are no bases in the sector capable of helping wanderers, it is overall better to quickly find a way out of it.

Since none of them answer any question, let alone acknowledge human presence, their purpose remains unknown.

Do not be fooled by the verdant colors and blooming life! Out of the many parts of the **Habitable Zone**, the Garden Sector is one of the few that doesn't suit human life.

Overgrown since times unknown, the Garden Sector has a rather unusual effect on human life. Staying there for even an hour will start twisting you, progressively turning you into a plant like many others in the past.

If you happen to find the entrance to the Concrete Garden, avoid it like the plague! It is far easier to deal with non-Euclidean geometry and liminality than losing yourself to deadly nature.

+* How to recognize settlement landmarks
,,by M.E.G. Team "Compass Point",,
------
Hello, wanderer! My name's Ale, and I'm a member of Team Compass Point M.E.G. Today, I'm going to explain to you how to easily find settlement landmarks in the wild.

This place isn't called "**Habitable Zone**" for nothing. It's actually hosting a lot of settlements made by people who banded together. If you find one, they will be able to help you recover from the harshness of the level and offer you a place to live in.

But getting there is the hard part. As you probably figured out by now, **Level 1** is huge. Reaaaally huge. And while sectors can help figure out where you are, it's not exactly gonna indicate where the closest outpost is.

So, to circumvent this, groups such as us put down several types of landmarks to guide you. They're usually pretty simple: a colorful piece of cloth with a group logo on it, with food or [[[object-1|Almond Water]]] and a note tied with it.

Their vibrant colors clash with the grey walls of this landscape, so look around for those! To make it even easier to find, they're usually put down near doors or on walls, sometimes hanging from neon lights too.

Notes will often contain indications on how to find the settlement of the group that made the landmark. Use it to find them! You can also wait near it for someone to come, but as you'll learn later down this page, Flickering makes it risky to stay in the halls for too long. So I'd rather advise you to actively look for the settlement.

If you take the contents of one of those landmarks, please take down the colored cloth and put it on the floor. This will allow us to know its contents have been taken, and we will refurnish it during a future patrol. Thanks for your cooperation, and good luck down there!

My dehydration had reached a fever pitch, becoming an insidious sickness that cloyed at my faculties. The area swirled around me into a steely vortex as I stumbled into walls. It was at my lowest when I saw it, a bottle of water, encapsulated in glass, sitting next to an emergency exit door. I sprinted to it, desperately clawing at the cap as soon as my grubby mitts could reach it.

I began sucking down the water, almost spitting it out immediately when I was greeted with a strange, nutty taste. I held it in, turning the bottle in my hands as I read the label. “Almond Water” was scrawled across it in a font straight out of the 1980s. I swallowed.  //what the hell was Almond Water?//  

The more I drank it, the better it tasted. It had a pleasant sweetness to it that rolled across the palate. Perhaps I was just thirsty, but this was almost certainly the best thing I had ever tasted in my life. I felt the dryness in my throat ease, and my headache fade. Joy filled my heart; I was saved! At least for now, I shouldn't underestimate this place. Who knows how long it would be until I found something else to eat or drink?

I was so engrossed in my good fortune I hadn’t even noticed the note next to it. I picked it off of the floor and gingerly opened it.

[[div class="page"]]
##000000|//Hello wanderer!//##
@@@@@@
##000000|//How auspicious that you’ve made it here, the fact that you’re reading this safely is no small feat. Your reward is this specially bottled Almond Water, courtesy of the Major Explorer Group. Please come find us, we can help you find your bearings and fully explain what is going on. There is still a long way to go, follow the corridors until you start seeing people, they will be able to guide you to safety.//##
@@@@@@
##000000|//Please leave the empty bottle here with the note so we can refill it. Thanks and good luck!//##
[[/div]]

My heart sank.

I had run out of the beverage.

I was so relieved. There //were// other people in here, and they seemed friendly. It made sense that this place would have an explorer group, with how big it was. I dribbled out the last drops from the bottle into my mouth, and I suddenly realized all of my faculties had completely returned to me. In fact, I think my vision was somehow //better// than before.

Just what was in this stuff?

I had a second wind, and I gently returned the bottle and the note and pushed through the double doors, pressing down the cold metal push bar as the door resisted my force. It slowly creaked open, and I slipped into a tight hallway. It was noticeably warmer, and there was a distinct lack of disgusting puddles.

I began wandering the corridors, opening doors while I ran my hands across the white concrete walls. Many of the small side rooms were empty and devoid of light. Maybe I could finally find a spot to get some proper rest.

A calm washed over me, my anxiety melting away. Perhaps I was finally becoming numb to this place, or maybe it was because I simply had something to drink.

But it was a good thing.

I didn't have the luxury to panic here.

Whatever sector you're in, it's safe to assume you've come across single or double pushable doors, sometimes with an exit sign above them. While they won't make you leave the level, they will lead you to the second zone of **Level 1**, the corridors.

Tight and labyrinthine by nature, they form a sprawling complex of dimly lit concrete pathways that can go on for kilometers. Don't be scared to enter them, however, as they're actually far safer than the halls.

Indeed, as you will quickly realize, the structure of the corridors isn't anomalous, which means you can finally trust your senses again to navigate. But beware nonetheless! This complex is convoluted, and it's still easy to lose yourself if you're not careful. So don't venture too deep if you can avoid it! If you have to, try finding a way to retrace your steps, for example by using yarn balls as an Ariane thread.

As for what the corridors hold within, you could compare them to cave systems back on Earth. They are safe from any hostile presence and are a great shelter for anyone looking to set up an encampment. However, they are also barren and lack resource presence. As such, make sure you gather everything you need before leaving the halls!

Of course, the corridors aren't devoid of rooms, quite the opposite in fact. However, much like the rest of the **Habitable Zone**, they are purposeless, devoid of sense and logic. Examples of those rooms are:
* Small office rooms with an old computer[[footnote]]They can rarely be a more specialized type of computer like [[[object-22|Wayback Machines]]].[[/footnote]] on an office table, dimly lit by a singular light bulb hanging from the ceiling.
* Tight spaces with brick walls surrounding them. (see video below)
* Large infirmaries with a singular hospital bed at the center and some tables on the sides.
* Rubber rooms with a chair in the middle of them, sometimes clipped into the floor.
* Wide rooms with paintings on the walls and floor.

Even with their absurd layout, those rooms are ideal spots to take a rest in. Their temperature fits human comfort, and their enclosed nature allows for a safe sleep. You can claim one of them as your own for the "night" to get some well-deserved sleep, which will allow you to look for groups more easily afterward.

+* Creating an Encampment in the Corridors
,,by Nomad Troop "Ariane thread",,
------
[[=]]
//Congratulations on finding the corridors, wanderer! As you read above, this place is much safer than the non-Euclidean halls, and therefore is the best place to settle in for the "night". Obviously, rest in such an inhospitable place is crucial in order to stay sane and efficient, allowing you to eventually find other people.//

//However, not all rooms in the corridors are made equal, and some of the wildest Backrooms tricks can be running here. Compiled down there is a list of the most frequently asked questions by new wanderers wishing to survive by themselves and set up a camp.//

@@— — //// — —@@
[[/=]]

++++* I've seen a lot of different room sizes so far. Is one any better than the rest?
Picking the right room is obviously important. Too small, and you won't be able to comfortably lie down or even be at risk of your own campfire. Too large, and you won't escape the feelings of dread and anxiety of the halls. Usually, the ideal size would be the size of a bedroom.

++++* How can I sleep in there?
The best-case scenario is if you managed to find a sleeping bag during your time in the halls. However, if you didn't get any, finding a room with a soft floor (like rubber or carpet) is your next best option. Using available furniture, like a mattress or a sofa, is also a possibility. Both of those cases aren't optimal, but are the most coziness **Level 1** can offer.

++++* Is it really impossible to find food in the corridors?
If you didn't find anything to eat or drink while in the halls but still have to enter the corridors, don't worry! While scarce, some can be found in the occasional furnished room. Be careful, however, as most of them will be either spoiled or infected. As a matter of safety, only consume what's protected within a bottle, jar, or can!

++++* Can I make a campfire here?
You can use planks you scavenged from crates to start a fire. However, keep in mind that not all rooms have air vents, and suffocating in the smoke of your own site is still a possibility. Keep in mind that camping equipment like portable stoves can be found in crates if you do not wish to eat cold food.

++++* There is a lock on my door; should I use it to be safe?
Avoid using natural locks at all costs! They are subject to disappearing when looked at. This means you wouldn't be able to open the door afterward, exposing you to a long, agonizing death trapped in what was meant to be a safe room.

++++* What about creatures?
Entities don't tend to wander within the corridors. Nevertheless, taking precautions to avoid a surprise attack is always a good thing. Barricading the door with furniture can usually nullify a random intrusion. Avoiding making too much noise during Flickering events can also help avoid potentially redirecting them to your location.

++++* I had a good sleep. Now what?
Abandoning your temporary camp is the best option. Make sure to retrace your steps up to the entrance you used to get to the corridors, and from there, keep on searching for us major groups. Keep it up! You're getting closer with every step.

The hours crawled by as I wandered through this new world. The fatigue and thirst quickly returned, thoughts of the so-called almond water creeping into the back of my mind. I needed to sleep. I opened every door, scouring every crevice of the area for somewhere to sleep. I had only found ruined crates and fragments of wood, nothing substantial.

It was almost another day when I found it, a small, cramped room with several mangy mattresses strewn about on the inside. I closed the door, placing one of the mattresses flush to the door, moving the others to help block the light. I laid down and passed out almost instantly, lost to the swirling darkness behind my eyelids.

I dreamed, perhaps for the first time since I had fallen in here. I dreamed of my parents, my dog, happy dreams which coalesced into the shadowy darkness clinging to the end of a corridor. I found myself wandering hallways similar to the yellow hell; however, the lights had turned a blood red, and the buzzing had become insanely intense. I sprinted and sprinted, but the hallway never ended, merely contorting itself in impossible ways as it sprawled out in front of me. The carpet became deeper and deeper until I found myself drowning in the dripping crevice I had found myself in. I desperately clung to the fibers, but they were too wet, and I watched the red lights fade above me. I began to choke as I sank into nothingness, and the carpet completely enveloped me.

I snorted myself awake in a cold sweat, disoriented as I sucked in air.

Thank the Lord, it was just a dream.

I panted, my heart throbbing as the mattress squeaked under the stress of my breathing. I sat up, back against the door, meditating as I tried to forget the dream. This was horrendous, just another blow after another blow. I felt like I had already gone through stages of grief trying to survive in here, maybe me thinking I could live on was just me bargaining with myself.

I bumped the mattress blocking the light with my foot, causing it to tumble over. The room was flooded with a pallid, fluorescent light, and for a moment, I truly felt defeated.

It was time to move on, I felt surprisingly well-rested given my waking nightmare. I shoved the mattress out of the way, and somehow it looked less appealing than it did before. I cringed as I pushed it out of the way, and I swung open the door.

As it squeaked open, I heard something behind me, like an electrical pulse. I turned to see the light in the room flickering ominously. I froze in place as the entire area went pitch black. There was no sound whatsoever, just my own stifled breathing. Then I heard something, a sound I had not heard before, the gentle slapping of skin on concrete. It grew louder, as if it were coming my way. I closed the door in front of me, my hair standing on end as I realized I had closed it too loudly. I could hear the muffled slaps run up to the door.

It took every ounce of my effort, but I held my breath. I could hear something milling about behind the door. Tears streamed from my eyes as my blood surged through my pumping heart. Adrenaline flooded every inch of my body, and I began to shake while I pressed my full weight against the door.

I gently placed my ear on the metallic surface, trying to figure out what was on the other side. All I could hear was light, labored breathing and the sound of claws gently scraping down the surface of the door.

We stood off there, my guest and I, for an inordinate amount of time. It played with the door, jiggling the handle and scraping at the thin layer of gray decorating its metal frame. I carefully metered my breathing, praying it would simply leave.

Like a gust of wind, sound returned to the level as the lights flicked back on, relief washing over me as I could at least see. I could hear whatever was on the other side scamper away, and I sank to the floor in relief.

I waited twenty minutes before carefully opening the door. The hallway was empty, clear from both directions, so I took a moment to inspect the door. Long sets of four claw marks were carved into the material. Clear, foamy, and viscous liquid was lolling down its surface, and fear rolled through me like an electric shock.

What the hell did I just encounter?

    caption=A photography of a part of the halls during a Flickering event.
]]

As its rather upfront name indicates, Flickering refers to random times when all the natural lights of the **Habitable Zone** switch off, engulfing the level in complete darkness. Don't be fooled by its simplicity, however! Out of all the Backrooms [[[phenomena]]], it might be one of the deadliest you can witness.

Both the start and duration of a Flickering event cannot be predicted. As such, their random nature is known to stress wanderers as soon as they begin, their innate fear of the dark getting the better of them.

You might think this sudden anxiety is warranted, as this phenomenon renders the possibility of losing yourself much higher. However, while this is true, the lack of light isn't the real danger. Indeed, like an anomalous night, Flickering allows for many creatures to come out and lurk, hunting for preys who cannot see them as easily.

No hall is safe during a Flickering event, whatever the sector is. As such, as soon as one starts, you must enter a corridor section fast:

[[div class="blankquote"]]
* Locate the nearest corridor entrance by looking for a green exit light faintly illuminating the door below it.
* Do NOT use a light source to walk up to it! Becoming the only bright light source in the area will only lead you to a quick death.
* Instead, find the wall connecting to said door, then slowly fumble towards the small light. This will allow you to avoid getting lost in the non-Euclidean architecture.
* Keep in mind most entities have evolved to hear even the faintest of sounds, so avoid running to your destination.
* Although corridors are also dark during the event, entities very rarely wander there[[footnote]]Meaning you can use a light source here without any danger.[[/footnote]]. You can therefore find a room to stay in until the lights come back.

Several steps into the hallway, my heart jolted. I quickly ran back to the room I had used as a refuge. My crowbar was still sitting on the ground where I had left it, right next to the mattress. I sighed in relief, grabbing the object and placing it back on my belt.

Finally, somewhat rested, I had a new pep to my step. Perhaps it was in part due to the adrenaline rush of hiding from whatever was behind the door, but I was motivated to keep moving and finally exit these haunting halls. The thirst and hunger had begun to set in again. I hoped my new friends at the Main Explorer Group mentioned in the note would leave me more goodies.

Hours passed as I wandered. I kept glancing upward with a newfound paranoia, but thankfully, the lights didn’t turn off again. Eventually, I came across another large door, this one heavily rusted from the multiple dents in its metallic surface.

I slowly opened it, gripping my crowbar as I eyed the contents of the next room. I saw a large corridor lined with metal shelves straight out of the back rooms of a retail store. They were stocked with crates composed of a familiar wood, the same wood I had seen scraps of throughout the area.

Seeing no immediate danger, I entered the room, the door groaning from its contorted shape. I walked up to the nearest crate and immediately stabbed it into the crack between the lid and the container with my crowbar. I awkwardly jimmied the object in before prying open the lid. It cracked open, splinters of wood scattering everywhere. I foolishly reached into the box, recoiling as something inside sliced into my finger.

Warmth spread down my hand as blood flowed from the laceration. I quickly tore off part of my sleeve and wrapped it tightly, grimacing from the sharp pain. I grabbed the crate and slammed it onto the floor, right under the light. It was full of small metal robots. They looked like vintage toys, with fraying paint and sharp edges, the kind you’d see in an antique shop. I tsked, kicking the box out of the way. I began ripping apart more crates, finding more useless garbage, and tossing all of it to the side.

One container had a mountain of dead mice, another panes of glass. Eventually, I found one with a single backpack in it. It was logoless and black; the zipper was broken, but it could still work well enough. I slung it over my shoulder and continued popping crates.

There was a single crate hidden behind the rest; it was far back on a shelf and enveloped in the shadows. I probably would have missed it if I hadn’t been so thorough searching the shelves. It had the word //”Rations”// written in fading black stencil on the side. I gently pulled the top off, the nails screeching in protest as they bent against the wood. I lifted the lid and was greeted by four metal water bottles.

They were metal, a silvery gray. The rightmost had a few dents, but this was the most promising lead I had found. I grabbed a bottle and popped it open as I sloshed the contents around. I smelled the liquid inside and was greeted by the pleasant scent of almonds. //More of this almond water stuff//, I thought as I took a sip. The incredible flavor and sweetness touched my lips again, and I quickly downed the entire beverage.

I cheered to myself as energy surged through me as my blood sugar balanced again. My headache quickly faded, and I sighed in relief, shaking the last few drops into my mouth as I discarded the empty container. I swiftly packed the other three bottles into my backpack and continued onward.

I will find these people. I knew I wasn’t alone in here.

This place wouldn't be a warehouse if it didn't host resources. Now that you've been wandering around for some time, it's safe to say you've come across some featureless wooden boxes, usually found on shelves or directly on the floor. Those boxes are called "crates" by wanderers and group members alike. While they look rather unassuming, they hold your only hope at survival: resources.

Usually appearing behind your back[[footnote]]With that in mind, remember to regularly watch behind you! Not only can you find crates behind you, but this also ensures an entity isn't sneaking up on you.[[/footnote]], or after a Flickering event, virtually anything can be found within them. In fact, their existence alone makes it possible to set up bases at this level, and therefore led to the level being named "the **Habitable Zone**", by the groups who set up there.

It's worth noting that crates can disappear once not looked at. As such, make sure you take everything you need before leaving one behind! A non-exhaustive list of useful objects to look for can be found in the guide below.

+* Crates Objects - A Guide
,,by Collecting Director Callum Andrews,,
------
[[div class="blockquote"]]
Crates of the **Habitable Zone** are by nature diverse in content. In this guide, I will explain what kind of objects should be prioritized, as well as some general advice when collecting them.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[=]]
++++* Avoiding Danger
[[/=]]
------
Crates hold many helpful items, but can also contain some harmful ones: chemicals, explosives, or even specific objects like glass shards or cubes of solid nitrogen. So always be prepared when opening a crate! Collectors typically wear gloves just in case, but the best tool is obviously patience. I understand you'll probably be excited to see food or [[[object-1|Almond Water]]] within them, but remember to always identify everything within the crate before putting your hands into it.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[=]]
++++* Beware Being Over-encumbered
[[/=]]
------
Chances are you'll find many valuable objects inside crates: food, tools... However, remember to not be greedy! Trust us, you can quickly become over-encumbered if you take everything that was ever so slightly interesting. This can lead to a lack of walking progress, or in worse cases, the impossibility of escaping from an entity.

Your backpack (or whatever bag you managed to find down there) has limited space, so only take what you're sure will be useful to you. If you start thinking "But this could help me if that overly specific situation happens!", then it's a good sign you don't really need it. Only pack up the essentials, what is generally useful for survival.
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
[[=]]
++++* Object Priority
[[/=]]
------
You must now be wondering "But what should I prioritize, then?" To this I would answer, "The sooner the need, the more important it is". The Backrooms can be unforgiving, raising many challenges you will need to overcome one by one.

After answering your immediate needs (such as changing filthy clothes or drinking after a day without water), you can consider the following:

* **Food** --
 * [[[object-1|Almond Water]]] (the main drink you'll find in the Backrooms)
 * cans/bocals of food (to avoid any contamination/potential spoiling)

* **Warm, clean clothes** --
 * A sweatshirt, a Christmas pullover, socks, ski pants... Anything that will keep you warm and not interfere with your movements
 * An extra outfit, if yours isn't practical, or damaged
 * Proper footwear, since you'll need to walk a lot to find people

* **Medical equipment** --
 * Bandages (or gauze) for potential injuries
 * Antiseptics and other "cleaning" equipment, such as soap or hand sanitizer[[footnote]]To avoid infection with [[[entity-19|Staphylococcus liminalis]]] or the [[[entity-17|Crawler Fungus]]].[[/footnote]]

* **Tools** --
 * A knife or an axe, to help open some crates or doors [[footnote]]Giving you material to use for barricades, for example.[[/footnote]], as well as come in handy to scare some smaller entities away[[footnote]]Such as [[[entity-25|Plague Goblins]]].[[/footnote]]
 * Fire-starting supplies, like matches or a lighter, can allow you to warm up your food and yourself (using planks from crates)
 *  Headlights or flashlight, to use in the corridors (but remember to not do so in the halls!)

* **Entertainment** --
 * Yarn is common in crates, so crochet can be a good way to relieve stress
 * Make sure to pick up a notepad with a pen. Write down who you are and what you're trying to do. Do not lose hope.

* **Other** --
 * A watch can help you keep track of time[[footnote]]Most Backrooms group uses the M.E.G. Standard Time (MST) timezone, which is tied to the GMT timezone on Earth.[[/footnote]]
 * A phone charger, crucial for you to be able to access the database at all times
 * A sleeping bag, although finding the right corridor room can circumvent its need

* **Backrooms objects** --
 * [[[object 101|Frvyo jades]]] can be used to detect entities close to you thanks to its reactive light.
 * [[[Object 19|Squirt Guns]]], although unassuming, can be a great ranged weapon with a lot of applications depending on the liquid used.
 * [[[object-74|Warpberries]]] can serve as a way to escape certain death[[footnote]]Although the chemicals contained within can prevent you from leaving the newly entered level for a good while depending on your metabolism, and should therefore be used as a last resort.[[/footnote]]
[[/div]]

[[div class="blockquote"]]
Now you should know everything you need about crates! Remember that if you need it, we at the Trader's Keep can and will keep you safe from the wilderness if you can pay for our protection. So good luck out there, and we hope to see you in the Gild Sector!

I had found a second wind.

With every echoing step, my spoils rang with a jovial rattle in my bag. The corridors, like the yellow hell, were almost dizzying in nature. Thankfully I was better equipped this time, and I felt more in control of the situation.

Time passed, I slept in more barricaded rooms, and found yet another crate of the almond water. While I was no longer thirsty, the hunger was creeping in; I began to search for help with even greater desperation.

Then, I heard it. A voice, a human voice, echoing down one of the corridors.

"//Hello?//"

It was clear as day, a woman's voice. "Is someone there?" I replied, hesitating, even though my heart soared.

"//Hellllloooo?//"

The voice sounded strained as I followed it down the hall. The lights flickered, the gaps of darkness long enough to make me squint. I came to a woman, a trail of blood leading up to her. She was wearing mottled clothes and appeared to be hunched over weeping.

"Miss, are you alright?" I stopped in the doorframe, wary of the woman in front of me.

"//No//", she said, unmoving.

"Let me help you, then." I walked up to her, my hand white-knuckling my crowbar. I was within three feet of her before she spoke again.

"//I need help, please.//"

I froze in place.

"W-with what?"

"//Well, it is all loose.//"

My heart pounded in my chest, my head spinning.

"What's loose?"

The woman turned around. Her skin hung from her body and face, like it had given up on clinging to her bones. She slowly reached up, grasping her hair as she pulled the skin taught on her face. It revealed strange eyes and pointed teeth as she began to smile. I then noticed something in the corner of my eye. What looked like a corpse, a body, was strewn across the ground. It noticeably was missing all of its skin, I could see its glistening muscles and bones shining hideously in a pool of blood. I looked forward, the woman now standing as the flickering lights intensified.

"//Hi.//"

Within an instant, her other arm was plunged into my shoulder's flesh, its wicked claws easily slicing into the bone. I screamed in pain, dropping to one knee as I clubbed her skull in with my weapon. She —or it— fell to the floor, convulsing from the blow. I swung the crowbar into it over and over again until it stopped moving. My vision blurred, and my heart slowed. I discarded the crowbar next to me as I collapsed onto the floor.

"Please, no". The thing stood up, the sheath of human sliding off of its sickly yellow skin. It wound up, its swing aimed at my life as I cringed helplessly on the ground. I heard a sickening thud, and the creature fell over; a machete remained embedded in its brain. My vision blurred as something rapidly approached me.

"//Miss?//"

The Backrooms isn't only made up of anomalous landscapes. It is an ecosystem, filled with unhinged creatures you've never seen before. Some of them are neutral towards humans, some can even be helpful, but most are predators. They represent an active, mobile threat that //will// get you if you're not careful.

As said previously, entities tend to hunt during Flickering events, but this doesn't mean you won't find any when the lights are on. As such, stay aware of moving presences around you at all times. This means looking around regularly, including the ceiling, floor, as well as behind you.

Entities all have different physical appearances and behaviors. If you see a creature you cannot identify from far away, refer to the general advice below and/or check the table for more specific advice. Keep in mind the database has most of them detailed in [[[entities|specific articles]]].

[[div class="dark-styled-quote"]]
+++* **To Do:**
------
* Avoid panicking at all costs. Being crippled by fear is common, but remember that as long as you're far away, you're safe.
* Silently go in the corridors to permanently lose them.
 * If you can't see any exit, hide behind a pillar or a crate until you hear them leave.
* If you need to leave quickly, retrace your steps to the previous landmarks you used for navigation to avoid getting lost.
[[/div]]

[[div class="dark-styled-quote"]]
+++* **To Avoid:**
------
* If you see or hear the entity approaching, do not run! The non-euclidian structure of the halls might bring you closer to the creature and get their attention faster.
* Do not use guns to harm the entity while far away! Although you might take down an entity, the noise will only bring more to you.
* Do not pick a close-up fight with any entity either. Again, overconfidence is one of the most common death cause for newcomers.
* Don't approach single humanoid presence when you're not sure they're humans. Keep in mind real people often wander around in groups.

I sat at the edge of a stiff, rough cot.

The fingers on my right hand gently scoured the rough scarring that had held my shoulder together. The memories were vague, almost dreamlike. They were images, moments, frozen in my mind like old photographs. More halls, the pool of red flowing out of me. I remembered seeing a man, me weakly flailing my crowbar at him as he embraced me.

He saved my life.

Through some miracle they had stitched me back together. After fighting a nasty infection, I was alive and informed of my situation. The base wasn't glamorous, hallways sprawled with beds, tents and scraps salvaged from the strange world. The denizens called it "The Backrooms", a rather appropriate title for the never-ending corridors.

It was overwhelming. I made my way through Base Alpha, kind folk nodding and patting my back as I made my way through. My survival was a small miracle, my recovery two months of agony. I was grateful, but anxious.

I clung to normalcy by frequenting the diner located near the base. Tom, the owner, was a kind soul who had somewhat taken me in after I became a regular.

"Hello my friend, your usual?" Tom smiled, crinkles appearing in the corners of his eyes.

I fidgeted with the menu, fully knowing I wasn't about to change my order.

"Yeah", I replied. handing the menu to him.

Tom took the menu, scratching the top of his arm with the corner of it as he walked away. I sat in silence, watching the wall as the minutes ticked by.

I was startled as a plate slammed down in front of me.

"Cheeseburger, still mooing. Oh, and a shake." Tom sat down in front of me, his jovial face wrinkled with concern. "Now what's going on, bud."

I stared at the burger for a moment, sliding the plate closer to me. "I'm afraid to leave, I don't know what's out there. God, I don't even know what to do, or where to go. I feel like a waste of space."

Tom chuckled, rolling his eyes as he leaned back, the seat squealing in protest.

"What?"

"Kid, you think you're the first person to wander in here and have an existential crisis?" He waved his hand at me, "You survived for a reason. You're meant to be here, to be a part of this world." Tom stood up, stretching as he walked away. "Now eat your food before it gets cold, and no more being dreary."

I halfheartedly scowled, but began to ruminate on his words.

//Maybe I could make a difference here, even if just a little.// I bit into the burger and sunk deeper into my thoughts.

Settlements represent your only chance for long-term survival in the Backrooms, granting you a place to eat and sleep in with other people. Thankfully for you, **Level 1** is one of the more populated pocket dimensions down there, meaning you WILL find human presence eventually.

Most of them are small encampments in either the halls or corridors, usually made out of tents or makeshift huts by a dozen of wanderers at most. However, the immensity of the **Habitable Zone** didn't stop humans from creating much bigger bases over time, sometimes even developing into full-blown factions, spanning several levels.

Whether small or big, not all of these settlements will be friendly to you, however. **Level 1** is so big, and encampments so separated, that this place remains mostly rule-free. Nevertheless, be wary of humans as much as you watch out for the anomalous creatures, as our species can easily be more monstrous than entities in a place with scarce resources.

A non-exhaustive list of relevant bases, outposts, and social points of the **Habitable Zone** can be found below. Keep in mind that hundreds of small to medium encampments are estimated to also exist there, although giving precise numbers is impossible.

[[tabview]]

[[tab M.E.G.]]
[[div class="megblock"]]
+* M.E.G. Base Alpha
------
Base Alpha is the oldest and second biggest settlement of the [[[the m e g|Major Explorer Group]]], dedicated to the training of new members, as well as exploration. Present in the Aquila Sector, it can offer you a safe place to eat and sleep in, if you are interested in helping explore and study the Backrooms in return.

More akin to a town than a settlement, Base Alpha has grown so much within the corridors that it is now completely unrecognizable from the encampment it was many years ago. If you do not wish to risk yourself on deeper levels yet, this will be your best opportunity for a Frontrooms-like life.

If you are interested in adventuring, however, Base Alpha is also dedicated to exploration, often training new operatives to work in other bases or in small outposts on deeper levels. Finding and understanding these levels to one day find an exit has been the M.E.G.'s core mission since its inception. As such, they will be more than willing to give newcomers like you the keys to help them reach this goal.

To read more about Base Alpha, its history, and its structure, refer to the [[[Base Alpha]]] article.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab B.N.T.G.]]
[[div class="bntgblock"]]
+* Trader's Keep
------
Thanks to their neutrality and their equipment, the Trader's Keep has quickly grown in prestige since its creation in 2016.

Unlike the M.E.G., the [[[B.N.T.G.|Backrooms Nonaligned Trade Group]]] is made of merchants and mercenaries. As such, they are more interested in payment or bartering than recruiting and training newcomers.

However, if you can pay their price, and are interested in their vision, the Trader's Keep is a great place to settle in. Indeed, their influence over the Gild Sector allows them to offer a much better quality of life and security than most other factions.

It's also worth noting that the Trader's Keep also contains the [[[Traders Vault|Trader's Vault]]], the largest known B.N.T.G. stocking facility. This allows the group to regularly furnish bases such as [[[Office Space EL3A]]] with resources to sell, thanks to their efficient web of interconnected trading routes.

To read more about the Trader's Keep and its Vault, refer to the [[[Trader's Keep]]] article.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Ariane Circle]]
[[div class="arianeblock"]]
+* Hippocrates-1
------
Hippocrates-1 is the first and main base of Team Hippocrates of the [[[cercle ariane|Ariane Circle]]]. Created far before the bigger faction was formed, the base is mainly centered around biological entity research, a mission that led the team to work closely with [[[The Leaders]]] in their time, as well as the M.E.G. As such, it is mainly thanks to them that most of the anomalous wildlife of the **Habitable Zone** has been documented for wanderer safety.

Although secondary, their healthcare mission is something they take very seriously. As such, they regularly form external agents, as well as provide medical equipment and personnel to other groups in exchange for resources. The medical care they provide directly at their base to ill or injured wanderers is free, however, as their mission remains making the Backrooms a safer place.

Most of the members of Hippocrates-1 speak English and Hoofish[[footnote]]A common Backrooms language originating from [[[level-51|The Lost]]].[[/footnote]] in addition to French, so do not hesitate to reach out to them if you are in the Gothic Sector.

[[tab Camp Amber]]
[[div class="amberblock"]]
+* Camp Amber
------
> Update -- Since 2013, Camp Amber has left the **Habitable Zone** and is now residing in [[[the-hub|the Hub]]].

Historically, the Backrooms have always had one huge multicultural faction aiming at protecting wanderers. Yet, empires rise and fall, and [[[The Leaders]]], the biggest group of the second half of the 20th century, was no exception. When they got destroyed in 1997, wanderer safety plummeted as a result, especially in **Level 1**, a realm hosting many clueless newcomers.

As such, Camp Amber was created around this date. Nomadic in nature, they used to travel between sectors to educate newcomers about the Backrooms and its dangers. Usually located near known exits from [[[Level 0]]], they helped countless wanderers by giving them advice and training them for their new life.

Following the creation of Base Alpha in 2012, a far more welcoming place from a group that was already growing fast, Camp Amber left the level one year later, relocating their activities to [[[the Hub]]], a safe highway level where new wanderers were also present.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Eyes of Argos]]
[[div class="argosblock"]]
+* Cornucopia
------
Malicious and cruel people, capable of the most deplorable of crimes. With the **Habitable Zone**'s constant influx of newcomers and the barren nature of the place, they are a grim reality within the level, and have been for centuries.

In the past, back when this place resembled a merchant site, Cornucopia was providing resources to the other settlements of [[[the Eyes of Argos]]]. Now that [[[The Enclave]]] occupies this purpose, the role of Cornucopia has shifted to punish the ever-flowing sinners so as to keep the second most populated Backrooms level peaceful.

This base has evolved across the ages, but its nature as headquarters for the Justice Seekers has remained. These soldiers tirelessly patrol the **Habitable Zone**, looking for sinners to punish in their everlasting mission.

If you have nothing to hide, you should be safe from their wrath. Nonetheless, contact with them is ill-advised, as their definition of justice can vary from team to team. Remember that sometimes, humans can be more dangerous than entities, especially when they deem they serve justice.

To read more about this specific base, refer to the [[[Cornucopia]]] base article.
[[/div]]
[[/tab]]

[[tab Speednoclippers]]
[[div class="speedblock"]]
+* Registration Spots
------
Unlike most of the other factions, the Speednoclippers don't have permanent bases, as their name represents more of a way of life than a united group. However, even if plenty of communities and online forums have different lifestyles, most still recruit new members through the temporary setup of registration spots, such as in the **Habitable Zone**.

Registration spots are usually simple in nature, ranging from makeshift wooden booths to tents. There, some Speednoclippers will be available to put interested newcomers to the test.

Even if a life of thrill and travels doesn't interest you, these registration spots are great places to learn about controlled no-clipping and how to perform them, which is a useful skill to have in times of need. The speakers can also bring you to nearby settlements, allowing you to rest for some time.

To learn more about the Speednoclippers, refer to the [[[Speednoclippers]]] group article.

[[/tab]]

[[tab Tom's Diner]]
[[div class="blockquote"]]
+* Tom's Diner
------
Tom's Diner is the biggest restaurant and social hub of the **Habitable Zone**, run by Tommaso Esposito (better known as Tom), an Italo-American chef, and his coworker [[[Aiko Sato]]].

Although it started as a simple food stall, his work quickly gained in popularity thanks to his meal quality, as well as his overall optimistic and light-hearted personality. Over the years, the area developed into a complete diner.

Most Backrooms groups use bartering as a money system, and Tom's Diner is no exception. A meal will cost you different resources depending on how elaborate it is. In addition, it is also common for people to bring their own ingredients to the diner as a way to both reduce the price and furnish the place for future meals.

Due to its renown, Tom's Diner has quickly grown into the biggest social place in the **Habitable Zone**. Whether you're looking for new friends or travel companions or wish to spend some time resting to the sound of the different artists making concerts here, the diner is your best bet to find people!

The M.E.G. pulled me from the hungry jowls of death, and now I proudly wear their insignia. My job is simple, I place supplies and notes in Level 0 and Level 1, I give back to the other newcomers so they too can write their tales.

Soon I will be able to explore this new world, but for now I will just welcome others to it.

To those reading this, DO NOT GIVE UP HOPE. There are groups out there who want you to live. The more of us in here means we all have a better chance to survive, a better chance to find a way out.

+ Entrances and Exits
[[/div]]

**Level 1** is just the beginning. The Backrooms are made of hundreds of other pocket dimensions, some sharing thresholds with the **Habitable Zone**. Below can be found the list of known thresholds leading to or away from here.

> Keep in mind this list isn't exhaustive, as new levels are constantly being discovered, and links between them can also [[[phenomenon-32|appear and disappear]]] over time. Most levels accessing to or being accessible from anywhere have also been ommitted for simplicity.

++ Entrances
So far, the only entrance to the **Habitable Zone** you know of is [[[Level 0]]]. However, many others have been discovered over the decades.

[[tabview]]

[[tab Doors]]
Most of them take the form of doors from other levels. In such cases, simply opening them and going through the threshold leads to **Level 1**. Known examples include:
* Certain random doors on **[[[trimmed:level-4-2|Level 4.2]]] - "Parking Lot of Fog"**
* Some building entrances on **[[[Level 11]]] - "The Endless City"**
* The door on  **[[[Level 12]]] - "Matrix"** after following a specific course of action
* Rusted metal doors on **[[[Level 40]]] - "Roller Rockin' Pizza!"**
* Sandstone doors on **[[[Level 46]]] - "Arabian Desert"**
* Certain doors on **[[[level-54|Level 54]]] - "Stairwell Of Spirals"**
* Doors on an office space on **[[[level-162|Level 162]]] - "The Concrete Wall"**
* Doors leading to non-noteworthy buildings on **[[[Level 215]]] - "Harborside View"**
* Certain doors connected to a building on **[[[Level 330]]] - "A Stroke of Colour"**
* Cardboard doors on **[[[Level 409]]] - "The Paper-Rooms"**
* Either door of the room on **[[[Level 726]]] - "Just A Regular Living Room"**
[[/tab]]

[[tab Smooth Thresholds]]
Some other entrances are smoother, which means there are gradual changes in the environment. In such cases, walking far enough into a specific section of a level can lead to **Level 1**. Examples include:
* Going back to blander corridors on **[[[Level 2]]] - "Abandoned Utility Halls"**[[footnote]]Also nicknamed "Pipe Dreams" by some wanderers.[[/footnote]]
* Following a concrete hall or corridors that gets progressiveley less glitchy on **[[[Level 38]]] - "Fold Point"**
* Using a flight of stairs or an elevator on **[[[level-141|Level 141]]] - "The Boiler Rooms"**
[[/tab]]

[[tab No-clipping]]
Entrances can also occur through no-clipping, similar to **[[[Level 0]]]**:
* Noclipping though a wall on **[[[Level 0.1]]] - "Zenith Station"**
* Touching or noclipping with a majority of objects or walls in VP 3 on **[[[level-84|Level 84]]] - "The Shifting Hedge Maze"**
* Noclipping through a concrete wall on **[[[level-128|Level 128]]] - "The Great Outdoors"**
* No-clipping through any platform's secondary wall as it recedes on **[[[level-162|Level 162]]] - "The Concrete Wall"**
* Noclipping through the floor in The Lounges of  **[[[Level 283]]] - "PlayLand"**
* Performing a controlled no-clip into the walls of the Main Hall on **[[[Level 294]]] - "The Liminary Theatre"**

It's worth noting than no-clipping doesn't only happen when going through a surface. Interacting with certain elements can also force a no-clip by "sucking" the wanderer in:
* Use a key card onto the screen displaying **Level 1** in **[[[the Surveillance Room]]]**
* Opening a supply crate with a red number one on **[[[level-58|Level 58]]] - "Water Wonder"**
* Eating a ham croissant on  **[[[Level 304]]] - "Las Panaderias"**
* No-clipping into a tree on **[[[Level 305]]] - "The Descent into Darkness"**
* Touching any green shape on  **[[[Level 322]]] - "Unrecognized Landscape"**
* Touching a mirror on **[[[Level 365]]] - "Your Worst Enemy"**
* Finding the sales floor and acquiring two bottles of almond water on  **[[[Level 852]]] - "Retail Therapy"**
[[/tab]]

[[tab Sub-levels]]
Some areas of the **Habitable Zone** are considered big and important enough to be classified as "sub-levels". They can be considered like other sectors of the level. As of today, they are:
* **[[[Level 1.1]]] - "Corrupted Corridor"**
* **[[[Level 1.2]]] - "Concrete Garden"**
* **[[[level-1-4|Level √2]]]**
* **[[[Level 1.5]]] - "Inverted"**
[[/tab]]

[[/tabview]]

++ Exits

[[[Level 2]]], also nicknamed "Abandoned Utility Halls", is the most common exit you will come across, as it is part of the "Main Twelve"[[footnote]]This term is used to present an assortment of levels from [[[level-0|0]]] to [[[level 11|11]]] that possess far more links between them than any other, which grants them a certain linearity. This is why new wanderers usually get from Level 0 to Level 1, rather than finding other rarer exits. This is also true between Level 1 and 2, Level 2 and 3, and so on.[[/footnote]]. The threshold from **Level 1** to Level 2 is a smooth one, meaning simply walking far enough in a direction with pipes and dials gradually appearing will make you enter the Abandoned Utility Halls.

Since the **Habitable Zone** is one of the most populated levels, a high number of other exits from it have been listed over the decades. However, not all of them can be seen with the naked eye, and some surfaces or walls can lead you to a whole different place by complete accident. To avoid being disoriented or lost after an accident noclip, remember to use the C.L.I.P.P. Protocol as soon as you enter a new level!

+* The C.L.I.P.P. Protocol Explained
,,By Team Hermes of the Ariane Circle,,
------
[[=]]
[[/=]]
The Backrooms is a reckless and illogical place, and many things can happen to you as soon as you enter a new level. With noclippable surfaces usually invisible, it's not uncommon for someone to enter a new level they've never heard of before, and be completely lost as to what to do to leave it.

As such, if you ever find yourself in a place you do not recognize, using the C.L.I.P.P. Protocol will help you avoid potential danger, and prepare yourself to explore:
* **C - Check your environment** to verify the presence of potential threats, as well as identify the architecture around you.
* **L - Locate an exit**, such as no-clipping back, or finding a door, window, or any other potential threshold.
* **I - Inspect the database**, using all the information you collected to find which level you're in, and which potential exit is safe to take.
* **P- Prepare your equipment** by taking relevant objects (like a weapon, flashlight...) or changing clothes if needed.
* **P - Perimeter your environment** by setting up a temporary safe zone

If you wish to find more information about the protocol, you can find it on the [[[phenomene-1-fr#toc11|Ariane Circle Database]]]. And with that, we wish you good luck on your travels! **Level 1** is merely the beginning of your journey.
[[/div]]

With that in mind, here are the known exits from the **Habitable Zone**:

[[tabview]]

[[tab Doors]]
Like **Level 1** entrances, most ways to exit it take the form of doors:
* Glass doors will lead to  **[[[Level 22]]] - "Ruins Left Behind"**
* Doors with unique symbols at the end of corridors with fluorescent lights will lead to  **[[[level-154|Level 154]]] - "The Laser Game"**
* Ice coated metal doors will lead to **[[[level-159|Level 159]]] - "Beastland"**
* Bunker doors will lead to  **[[[Level 218]]] - "Dead Man's Mile"**
* Wooden door in nonsensical locations will lead to  **[[[Level 389]]] - "The Gaming Hall"**
* Elusive doors that feels slightly colder than the surrounding walls will lead to  **[[[Level 740]]] - "Reactor Ruins"**
* Metal double doors that resembles those of lifts or elevators will lead to a staircase going to **[[[Level 998]]] - "A Path Across Hell, and Towards Any Beyond"**
* Plain-white, wooden doors will lead to **[[[Level 998.2]]] - "Fight Club"**
* Specific sequence of doors and halls can take the wanderer to **[[[The Hub]]]**
[[/tab]]

[[tab Smooth Thresholds]]
Similarely so, smooth thresholds also exists within the level:
* Climbing up into holes into the ceiling can lead to  **[[[Level 19]]] - "Attic Floorboards"**  
* Walking in a corridor getting gradually more glitchy will eventually lead to **[[[Level 38]]] - "Fold Point"**
* Breaches in some walls displaying the exterior can lead to **[[[level-128|Level 128]]] - "The Great Outdoors"**
* Speaking the level name of [[[level-352|bHZsMzUy]]] in any language involving the Latin Alphabet in an intelligible manner will open a threshold to the level[[footnote]]We heavily advise against using it, however, as the level present a lack of food and drink, as well as a lot of entities who entered through similar ways.[[/footnote]]
* Going into an open ventilation duct will lead to  **[[[Level 800]]] - "House of Clockwork"**
[[/tab]]

[[tab No-clipping]]
No-clipping is equally as common, and as notified above, can occur by complete accident:
* The entrance to **[[[level-24|Level 24]]] - "The Moon"** is being kept secret by the [[[B.N.T.G.]]], but is rumored to be a painting of the Moon like the one on [[[Level 57]]]
* Noclipping through some walls can lead to  **[[[level-128|Level 128]]] - "The Great Outdoors"**
* Using a VHS tape labeled "Mach+" will make you noclip into the TV to reach  **[[[Level 201]]] - "//A E S T H E T I C//"**
* No-clipping into a dead tree will lead to **[[[Level 305]]] - "The Descent into Darkness"**
* Going through a painting depicting a [[[entity-99|jester-looking character]]] will lead you to **[[[Level 389]]] - "The Gaming Hall"**
* Landmarks that are part of the Pilgrim's Path can no-clip you when touched, going into another level with a landmark. Continuing doing so will eventually lead you to **[[[Level 710]]] - "Ring and Ruins"**
* Jumping in a painting that depicts a rocky island with a withered tree on top of it will lead to  **[[[Level 739]]] - "Sands of Desire"**
* Clipping through a crate containing scrap metal will lead you to  **[[[Level 817]]] - "The Scrapyard"**
[[/tab]]

[[tab Sub-levels]]
The aforementionned sub-levels of the **Habitable Zone** can be accessed directly from it. They are:
* The entrance of **[[[Level 1.1]]] - "Corrupted Corridor"** can be found at the south of Base Alpha.
* The passage leading to **[[[Level 1.2]]] - "Concrete Garden"** is within the Aquila Sector
* The access to **[[[level-1-4|Level √2]]]** hasn't been confirmed as of yet
* **[[[Level 1.5]]] - "Inverted"** can be accessed through no-clipping
